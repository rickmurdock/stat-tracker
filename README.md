Build an application people can use to track any stats they want about themselves on a daily basis.

You are going to build an application to track personal statistics about their activities. A personal statistic is a numerical record for a person in a time series by day. For example, let's say you wanted to track how many flights of stairs you walked up in a day. A sample week might look like:
 
  
| Date |	Flights |
| --- | --- |
| 06/19/2017	| 8 |
| 06/20/2017	| 6 |
| 06/21/2017	| 7 |
| 06/22/2017	| 6 |
| 06/23/2017	| 8 |
| 06/24/2017	| 4 |
| 06/25/2017	| 6 |
 
  
Users of your application can create as many different activities to track as they want.

You will be building an API to create and serve this data backed by MongoDB.

### API Specification  

For your API, we have specified the endpoints you'll need and what they should do. The URLs we using are not prefixed: yours should have `/api/` in front of them.

All the endpoints require authentication. You can use JSON Web Tokens for authentication, or if you prefer, you can use HTTP Basic Authentication. Feel free to use [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) to make this part easier.

| Verb | URL| Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET |	/activities	| Show a list of all activities I am tracking, and links to their individual pages
| POST |	/activities	| Create a new activity for me to track.
| GET |	/activities/{id} | Show information about one activity I am tracking, and give me the data I have recorded for that activity.
| PUT |	/activities/{id} | Update one activity I am tracking, changing attributes such as name or type. Does not allow for changing tracked data.
| DELETE |	/activities/{id}| Delete one activity I am tracking. This should remove tracked data for that activity as well.
| POST |	/activities/{id}/stats| Add tracked data for a day. The data sent with this should include the day tracked. You can also override the data for a day already recorded.
| DELETE |	/stats/{id}	| Remove tracked data for a day.

### Hard mode  

Build a front-end for your API using HTML, CSS, and browser-side JavaScript.
